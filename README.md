### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abdelhak and I'm a Ph.D. Student in Robotics at the SATIE lab of Paris-Saclay University.

My research interests include mobile robotics, indoor and outdoor localization, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), embedded systems, artificial intelligence and a little of computer vision. I work also as a research and development engineer at ez-Wheel as part of my Ph.D. studies.

I love Free and Open Source softwares, I like coding in C/C++, Rust and Python.
