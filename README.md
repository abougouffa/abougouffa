### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is _Abdelhak_ and I'm a Ph.D. Student in Robotics at the [SATIE lab](http://satie.ens-paris-saclay.fr/) of [Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) and a R&D Robotics Engineer (as part of my Ph.D. studies).

My research interests include:

- Mobile Robotics :robot:
- State Estimation and Sensor Fusion :chart_with_downwards_trend:
- Indoor and Outdoor Localization :satellite:
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) :car:
- Embedded Systems :pager:
- Artificial intelligence :ghost:
- and a little of Computer Vision :camera:

I work also as a research and development engineer in robotics at ez-Wheel as part of my Ph.D. studies.

I love Free and Open Source softwares, I :heart: coding in C/C++, Rust and Python. I spend most of my time in a Vim-flavored Emacs, thanks to [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs).
